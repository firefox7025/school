    <p>It was a rainy Saturday night when a man named Joe had his neighbors over for dinner, to put his mind off his dead end job at a soul crushing corporate job. His neighbors couldn't ever get enough of
    Joe's native mexican dishes, and nothing fueled Joe's spirit more than brining the spice to others faces over a good meal. His neighbors decided to pool their resources and invest in getting Joe his own resturant.
    Thus Joe's Jalapeño's was born, and since that Joe has been full of life, adding spice and happiness to anyone and everyone who walks through our door.
